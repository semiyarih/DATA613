<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-time-git-setup">First-Time Git Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.</li>
</ul>
<section id="your-identity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-identity">Your Identity</h3>
<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>
<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-editor" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-editor">Your Editor</h3>
<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-default-branch-name" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-default-branch-name">Your default branch name</h3>
<p>By default Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with git init. From Git version 2.28 onwards, you can set a different name for the initial branch.</p>
<p>To set main as the default branch name do:</p>
<pre><code> git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or</p></li>
<li><p>You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work</p>
<section id="create-a-directory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-directory">1. Create a Directory</h3>
<p>So Let us create a directory called <code>Hamid</code><br>
You need to type - <code>mkdir Hamid</code> , where <code>mkdir</code> means “Make Directory” and go to this directory. - <code>cd Hamid</code>, where <code>cd</code> stands for “Change Directory”. Now we can have our files in it. <img src="./graphix/init_4.png" class="img-fluid"> - We want to add files to a Git repository. We have to initialize a new empty repository. - So we type <code>git init</code> - The <code>git init</code> is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new <code>. git</code> subdirectory in your current working directory.</p>

<section id="recording-changes-to-the-repository" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recording-changes-to-the-repository">Recording Changes to the Repository</h3>
<p>At this point, you should have a bona fide Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or working copy of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-the-status-of-your-files" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="checking-the-status-of-your-files">Checking the Status of Your Files</h3>
<p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git status

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
<p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server.</p>
<p>I have created a directory called it Spring24 and added the <code>.gitignore</code> to my project folder. If I run the <code>git status</code> command I will get</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can see that your new <code>.gitignore</code> file is untracked, because it’s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged; Git won’t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="tracking-new-files" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tracking-new-files">Tracking New Files</h2>
<p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the <code>.gitignore</code> file, you can run this:</p>
<pre><code> git add .gitignore</code></pre>
<p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran git add is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot.</p>
<section id="short-status" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-status">Short Status</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Let us add a new line to the “README.md” file</p></li>
<li><p>While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run <code>git status -s</code> or <code>git status --short</code> you get a far more simplified output from the command:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>New files that aren’t tracked have a <code>??</code> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <code>A</code>, modified files have an <code>M</code> and so on. There are two columns to the output — the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree.</p>
</section>
<section id="viewing-your-staged-and-unstaged-changes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="viewing-your-staged-and-unstaged-changes">Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes</h3>
<p>If the git status command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the git diff command. We’ll cover git diff in more detail later, but you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged? And what have you staged that you are about to commit? Although git status answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, git diff shows you the exact lines added and removed — the patch, as it were.</p>
<pre><code>git diff</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That command compares what is in your working directory with what is in your staging area. The result tells you the changes you’ve made that you haven’t yet staged.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lines after a “<code>+</code>” are being added. Lines after a “<code>-</code>” are being removed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git diff</code> won’t check for changes in the staged files by default. But if you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use <code>git diff --staged</code>. This command compares your staged changes to your last commit:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git diff --staged</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It’s important to note that <code>git diff</code> by itself doesn’t show all changes made since your last commit — only changes that are still unstaged. If you’ve staged all of your changes, <code>git diff</code> will give you no output.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="committing-your-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="committing-your-changes">Committing Your Changes</h2>
<p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them — won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk.</p>
<p>The simplest way to commit is to type git commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "Write a concise, and describe what has been changed since the last commit"</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let us commit the <code>.gitignore</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git commit -m "Add .gitignore to history"</code></pre>
<section id="viewing-the-commit-history" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="viewing-the-commit-history">Viewing the Commit History</h3>
<p>After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, you’ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the <code>git log</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp6.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent commits show up first. As you can see, this command lists each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author’s name and email, the date written, and the commit message.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the more helpful options is <code>-p</code> or <code>--patch</code>, which shows the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit. You can also limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using <code>-2</code> to show only the last two entries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp7.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="undoing-things" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="undoing-things">Undoing Things</h2>
<ul>
<li>At any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we’ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you’ve made. Be careful, because you can’t always undo some of these undos. This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.</li>
</ul>
<section id="amend" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="amend">AMEND</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>--amend</code> One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the –amend option:</li>
</ul>
<p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message. + Case 1: Let’s say you just committed and you made a mistake in your commit log message. Running this command when there is nothing staged lets you edit the previous commit’s message without altering its snapshot. i) The command line without <code>-m</code></p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend</code></pre>
<p>The default text editor will be opened up in which you can replace the message from your older commit. Save and exit the text editor and your change will be made.</p>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li>he command line</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>git commit --amend -m "Your Message"</code></pre>
<p>enter the your correct message.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 2: Say that your last commit is missing a crucial file. Without it, your project worth nothing</li>
<li>Add the missing file.</li>
<li>Stage the changes:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git add &lt;missing_file&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now, amend the last commit we use</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git commit --amend</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend --no-edit</code></pre>
<p>This command will change the files in your last commit. It will not change the message associated with the commit because we have not used the <code>-m</code> flag.</p>

<section id="working-with-remote" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-remote">Working with Remote</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the <code>git remote</code> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve “cloned” your repository, you should at least see <code>origin</code></p></li>
<li><p>You can also specify <code>-v</code>, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp8.png" class="img-fluid"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working with several collaborators might look something like this.</p>
<p>$ git remote -v bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch) bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push) cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch) cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (push) defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch) defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push) koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch) koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push) origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch) origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)</p>
<p>This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily. We may additionally have permission to push to one or more of these, though we can’t tell that here.</p>
<p>Adding Remote Repositories We’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the “git clone” command implicitly adds the “origin remote” for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run</p>
<pre><code>git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp9.png" class="img-fluid"> Now you can use the string pb on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run <code>git fetch pb</code>:</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp10.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Paul’s master branch is now accessible locally as pb/master — you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. We’ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in <strong>Git Branching Section</strong>.</p>
<section id="fetching-and-pulling-from-your-remotes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fetching-and-pulling-from-your-remotes">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</h3>
<p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to note that the <code>git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pushing-to-your-remotes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pushing-to-your-remotes">Pushing to Your Remotes</h3>
<p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: <code>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>. If you want to push your master branch to your origin server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See <strong>Git Branching Section</strong> for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers. ### Inspecting a Remote If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the <code>git remote show &lt;remote&gt;</code> command. If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as origin, you get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp11.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information. The command helpfully tells you that if you’re on the master branch and you run git pull, it will automatically merge the remote’s master branch into the local one after it has been fetched. It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.</p>
</section>
<section id="renaming-and-removing-remotes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="renaming-and-removing-remotes">Renaming and Removing Remotes</h3>
<p>You can run <code>git remote rename</code> to change a remote’s shortname. For instance, if you want to rename pb to paul, you can do so with <code>git remote rename</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s worth mentioning that this changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too. What used to be referenced at <code>pb/master</code> is now at <code>paul/master</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you want to remove a remote for some reason — you’ve moved the server or are no longer using a particular mirror, or perhaps a contributor isn’t contributing anymore — you can either use <code>git remote remove</code> or <code>git remote rm</code>:</p></li>

<h1>Git Branching:</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.</p></li>
<li><p>A branch is an “alternative universe” of your project, where you can experiment with new ideas (e.g.&nbsp;new data analyses, new data transformations, new statistical methods). After experimenting, you can then “merge” your changes back into the main branch.</p></li>
<li><p>Branching isn’t just for group collaborations, you can use branching to collaborate with yourself, e.g., if you have a new idea you want to play with but do not want to have that idea in main yet.</p></li>
<li><p>The “main” branch (the default in GitHub) is your best draft. You should consider anything in “main” as the best thing you’ve got.</p></li>

<section id="creating-a-new-branch" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-new-branch">Creating a New Branch</h2>
<p>What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around. Let’s say you want to create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git branch command:</p>
<pre><code>git branch testing</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch1.png" class="img-fluid"> - <strong>How does Git know what branch you’re currently on?</strong> It keeps a special pointer called HEAD. In Git, this is a pointer to the local branch you’re currently on. In this case, you’re still on master. The git branch command only created a new branch — it didn’t switch to that branch.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="switching-branches">Switching Branches</h3>
<p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the <code>git checkout</code> command. Let’s switch to the new testing branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout testing</code></pre>
<p>This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>What is the significance of that?</strong> Well, let’s do another commit: <img src="./graphix/comp14.png" class="img-fluid"> <img src="../graphix/branch4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is interesting, because now your testing branch has moved forward, but your master branch still points to the commit you were on when you ran git checkout to switch branches. Let’s switch back to the master branch:</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp15.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That command did two things. It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the master branch, and it reverted the files in your working directory back to the snapshot that master points to. This also means the changes you make from this point forward will diverge from an older version of the project. It essentially rewinds the work you’ve done in your testing branch so you can go in a different direction.</p>
<p>Let’s make a few changes and commit again:</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/comp16.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now your project history has diverged. You created and switched to a branch, did some work on it, and then switched back to your main branch and did other work. Both of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the branches and merge them together when you’re ready. And you did all that with simple branch, checkout, and commit commands.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch6.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can also see this easily with the git log command. If you run <code>git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all</code> it will print out the history of your commits, showing where your branch pointers are and how your history has diverged. <img src="../graphix/comp17.png" class="img-fluid"><br>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-branching">Basic Branching</h4>
<ul>
<li>First, let’s say you’re working on your project and have a couple of commits already on the master branch.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch7.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You’ve decided that you’re going to work on issue #53 in whatever issue-tracking system your company uses. To create a new branch (iss53) and switch to it at the same time, you can run</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b iss53    # Create "iss53" branch and switch branch to "iss53"</code></pre>
<p>This is shorthand for:</p>
<pre><code>git branch iss53       # Creat a new branch named "iss53"</code></pre>
<pre><code>git checkout iss53     # Switch to branch "iss53" </code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch8.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You work on your website and do some commits. Doing so moves the <code>iss53</code> branch forward, because you have it checked out (that is, your <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to it)</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch9.png" class="img-fluid"> Now you get the call that there is an issue with the website, and you need to fix it immediately. With Git, all you have to do is switch back to your <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p>However, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you’re checking out, Git won’t let you switch branches. It’s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. Let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your <code>master</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master    # Switch to branch "master"</code></pre>
<p>At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working on issue #53, and you can concentrate on your hotfix.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a <code>hotfix</code> branch on which to work until it’s completed:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b hotfix   # Create "hotfix" branch and switch branch to "hotfix"</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch10.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now, you work on this issue after you fix it you want to run your tests to make sure the hotfix is what you want, and finally “merge” the <code>hotfix</code> branch back into your <code>master</code> branch to deploy to production. You do this with the <code>git merge</code> command</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)</code></pre>
<p>You’ll notice the phrase “fast-forward” in that merge. Because the commit <code>C4</code> pointed to by the branch <code>hotfix</code> you merged in was directly ahead of the commit <code>C2</code> you’re on, Git simply moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a “fast-forward.”</p>
<p>Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the master branch, and you can deploy the fix.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch11.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>After your super-important fix is deployed, you’re ready to switch back to the work you were doing before you were interrupted. However, first you’ll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer need it — the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d hotfix</code></pre>
<p>Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout iss53</code></pre>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch12.png" class="img-fluid"> #### Basic Merging Suppose you’ve decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your <code>master</code> branch. In order to do that, you’ll merge your iss53 branch into master, much like you merged your <code>hotfix</code> branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the <code>git merge command</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge iss53
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
index.html |    1 +
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>
<p>This looks a bit different than the <code>hotfix</code> merge you did earlier. In this case, your development history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch you’re on isn’t a direct ancestor of the branch you’re merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a simple <em>three-way merge</em>, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch13.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this <em>three-way merge</em> and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.</p>
<p><img src="../graphix/branch14.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the iss53 branch. You can close the issue in your issue-tracking system, and delete the branch:</p>
<pre><code> git branch -d iss53</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="basic-merge-conflicts" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-merge-conflicts">Basic Merge Conflicts</h4>
<p>Occasionally, this process doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly. If your fix for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the <code>hotfix</code> branch, you’ll get a <em>merge conflict</em> that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git merge iss53
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
<p>Git hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run <code>git status</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)

    both modified:      index.html</code></pre>
<p>no changes added to commit (use “git add” and/or “git commit -a”) Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn’t been resolved is listed as unmerged. Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts. Your file contains a section that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;contact : email.support@github.com&lt;/div&gt;
=======
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
 please contact us at support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53:index.html</code></pre>
<p>This means the version in <code>HEAD</code> (your <code>master</code> branch, because that was what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the <code>=======</code>), while the version in your <code>iss53</code> branch looks like everything in the bottom part. In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself. For instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
please contact us at email.support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This resolution has a little of each section, and the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines have been completely removed. After you’ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run git add on each file to mark it as resolved. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.</p>
<p>If you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run <code>git mergetool</code>, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:</p>
<pre><code>$ git mergetool

This message is displayed because 'merge.tool' is not configured.
See 'git mergetool --tool-help' or 'git help config' for more details.
'git mergetool' will now attempt to use one of the following tools:
opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge p4merge araxis bc3 codecompare vimdiff emerge
Merging:
index.html

Normal merge conflict for 'index.html':
  {local}: modified file
  {remote}: modified file
Hit return to start merge resolution tool (opendiff):</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use a merge tool other than the default (Git chose opendiff in this case because the command was run on macOS), you can see all the supported tools listed at the top after “one of the following tools.” Just type the name of the tool you’d rather use.</p>
<p>After you exit the merge tool, Git asks you if the merge was successful. If you tell the script that it was, it stages the file to mark it as resolved for you. You can run git status again to verify that all conflicts have been resolved:</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

    modified:   index.html</code></pre>
<p>If you’re happy with that, and you verify that everything that had conflicts has been staged, you can type <code>git commit</code> to finalize the merge commit. The commit message by default looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Merge branch 'iss53'

Conflicts:
    index.html
#
# It looks like you may be committing a merge.
# If this is not correct, please remove the file
#   .git/MERGE_HEAD
# and try again.


# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   modified:   index.html
#</code></pre>
<p>If you think it would be helpful to others looking at this merge in the future, you can modify this commit message with details about how you resolved the merge and explain why you did the changes you made if these are not obvious.</p>
